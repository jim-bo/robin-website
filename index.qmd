# ROBIN

### Radiation Oncology-Biology Integration Network


The long-term goal of ROBIN is to encourage the creation of new ideas for radiation and combination therapy trials.

* Test translational hypotheses that advance the understanding of mechanistic interactions and biologic consequences of RT through the course of radiation.

* Collect longitudinally and spatially annotated research biospecimens prior to, during, and after RT to elucidate:
    * toxicity and resistance signals that are more likely to develop very early during treatment and could be preventable
    * new anti-cancer drug targets
    * if the current therapeutic strategy remains optimal for the patient
